<h1>Learning to program in Ruby</h1>
<p>
  I've been learning to program using Ruby for a while and managed to create
  several programs using many different methods. Here are some methods
  that I used: while, mk.time, class, if, and others. Some were easy
  to do and others quite difficult. Sometimes I would get excited and spend
  hours working on these programs, looking and studying the code to
  find where the error was, and when I realized it, it was something small and simple.
</p>

<p>
  But it's really fun to do these projects using Ruby. To learn Ruby on Rails,
  I studied the book <a href='https://www.jmonteiro.com/aprendaaprogramar/' title='The book I studied to learn programming' target='_blank'>Aprenda a Programar</a>.
  It has several exercises to do, and these exercises are different in each chapter, first with an explanatory part
  and at the end some challenges. For those who are learning Ruby on Rails, you can check my <a href='https://github.com/nicollinoxx/aprendendo-programar' target='_blank'>repository</a>
  and use it as a reference to do the book's challenges or your own program. In this repository are all the projects I've made,
  and I'll post more programs there because there's always more to learn.
