  <p>
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
    It allows the separation between the content of a document and its appearance, offering an efficient way to control the formatting and
    layout of multiple pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Playing with CSS was one of the most fun steps during my learning process to start developing. Initially, I focused only on learning
    how things worked and how to use them. I didn't try at first to copy the styling of Netflix or Prime Video, but just the
    essentials so I could experiment and later apply what I had learned after finishing the tutorial.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have some projects with CSS and HTML in the repositories: <a href="https://github.com/nicollinoxx/aprendendo-programar">Aprendendo a programar</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/nicollinoxx/Pensamento_computacional">Pensamento computacional</a>. "Pensamento computacional" is a subject from
    the software engineering course, and I created this repository to store some projects with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that were developed in
    class.

  <h2>First styling with CSS</h2>
  <p>
    I continued my studies on page styling as soon as I finished development with HTML. I learned from the same site where I started
    using HTML, at: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>. However, I followed the tutorial from the site,
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/CSS">Introduction to CSS</a>, to be able to style some pages. At the end of the
    tutorial, I ended up with a very simple page where I applied some CSS attributes, really very little, but enough to start
    an evolution in creating more beautiful and pleasant screens.

    <h3>Badge</h3>
    <p>
      The badge was an assignment given by a software engineering professor at a college I attend. The goal was to make a simple badge
      using only HTML and CSS. That day, I doubted whether I could really do it, as it had been a considerable time since
      I last practiced CSS and I was using front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind to make development processes
      faster and easier. These frameworks offer easier and quicker styling, which allowed me to focus more
      precisely on the back-end of applications, since the screens were made quickly.

    <h3>Game Store Website</h3>
    <p>
      A little before I started writing this post, I developed a simple website using only HTML and CSS that tries to simulate a
      virtual game store. I tried to keep the site as simple and objective as possible, but also elegant and pleasant to maintain a good
      user experience. Also, compared to previous screens, there was a significant leap in styling experience and
      organization of the other screens.
