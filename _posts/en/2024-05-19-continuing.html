<p>
  I started my journey as a developer in 2020 and, since then, I have been developing several 
  applications. Later on, I will add more posts to share in more detail about my path until I 
  started using the Ruby on Rails framework and developing some projects. Currently, I develop 
  applications using Ruby on Rails and, during these 3 years, I have been improving my skills with 
  this framework. You can visit my repositories on my GitHub profile

  During my development with Ruby on Rails, I also learned to use Active Record, including validations, 
  migrations, and associations to handle databases, as well as SQLite and PostgreSQL for data storage. 
  On the front-end, I have gained experience with styling frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, 
  which allow me to create modern and responsive user interfaces. Additionally, I have studied development 
  methodologies such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), as well as some design and user experience concepts.
